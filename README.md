# Tissue Paper Holder - SolidWorks Project

## 📐 Project Description
This repository contains the complete 3D design, assembly, and technical drawings for a **Tissue Paper Holder** created in SolidWorks. The project showcases a wooden tissue paper holder designed for household or office use. The repository includes SolidWorks part and assembly files, technical drawings in PDF format, and rendered images of the final design.

This project can be used for learning purposes, manufacturing the holder, or as a reference for other CAD design projects.
